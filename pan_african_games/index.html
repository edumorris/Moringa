          commonly known as board game is a men only game among the Luo. The game is played on a board bearing sixteen holes; eight each side. Though also common among most communities in Kenya, the number of holes and rules of the game varies from one place and the other. He game is usually played by two people at a time in which the winner gets a price in the form of livestock. At the onset, each player organizes his side of the board as he sees fit. Every time a player wins some chips, he puts them aside until it is no longer possible to play. At the end, the player rearranges the board as they found it before the game, and it is usually at this point that the winner is determined. The significance of the game is not only to pass time but also a measure of accuracy, speed and wittiness.

            <li>Pebbles, stones or marbles are placed in the holes.</li>

            <li>Each hole may contain 3 to 5 marbles</li>

            <li>The players re-arrange the seeds in their row. Holes can become empty, but there must be at least one hole whose contents can reach an occupied hole on the opponent's side on the first lap, when sown clockwise.</li>

            <li>On his turn, a player must distribute the contents of the leftmost hole of his row in a clockwise direction, which reaches an occupied hole of the opponent's side in the first lap. If this is not possible, a player may sow the contents of the leftmost hole, which ends in the first lap in an opponent's hole that is empty. If this is not possible either, he must sow the contents of the leftmost hole, which ends in an empty hole on his side.</li>

            <li>When the last seed falls into an occupied hole, which hasn't been "married", its contents are picked up and distributed in another lap.</li>

            <li>If the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, an opponent's hole containing just one seed (after either player has captured) or a "married" hole, the move ends ("sleeps").</li>
