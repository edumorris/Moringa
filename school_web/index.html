					<strong>Learners Haven</strong> has an inclusive culture that encourages all students to invest in the community and participate in a wide range of activities. Day students are no exception; they often stay on campus long after their academic and sports commitments are complete and join the numerous clubs and activities that are available to them. In fact, most of our day students will tell you that they go home only to sleep.

					At Learners Haven, it’s not about the grade, or how well you perform on a test; it is about developing a lifelong passion for learning. Imagine yourself in classes with no more than 16 students and in which your teachers encourage your questions and participation. The Harkness Method is often utilized in English and history classrooms, and weekly labs are performed in the sciences.

					At Learners Haven leadership is integrated into every aspect of our culture; we provide grade-level appropriate curricular and extra-curricular opportunities to apply learning in real time, in real conditions, in ordinary and extraordinary circumstances for all four years of a Learners Haven education.
